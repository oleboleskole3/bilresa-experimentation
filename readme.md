# IKEA Bilresa scrollwheel remote experimentation and possible reverse engineering / custom firmware

Having just purchased an IKEA bilresa remote, and being dissatisfied with it's zigbee compatability mode (and completely unable to pair to home assistant through matter), I've decided to try to make a custom firmware for the device


## IF ANYONE IS ABLE TO AQUIRE A FIRMWARE UPDATE FILE OR DUMP THE FIRMWARE ON THE DEVICE PLEASE LET ME KNOW
